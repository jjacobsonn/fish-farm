# Problem-Solving Conversations

## Example Issues & Solutions
- **Fish facing backwards:** Analyzed image orientation and flipping logic; updated code and data to ensure correct direction.
- **Game broke after changes:** Used git to revert to a working state; emphasized incremental, testable edits.
- **Neon Tetra movement:** Customized animation logic for specific fish.
- **UI scaling:** Discussed and planned for wider, more immersive aquarium.

## Approach
- Careful analysis of code and requirements before making changes.
- Use of version control for safe experimentation.
- Iterative improvements based on feedback and playtesting.
